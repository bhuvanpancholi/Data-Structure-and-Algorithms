TIME COMPLEXITY

        It measures -> how the running time of an algoritm increases with the size of the Input Data

BIG O NOTATION - order of n ---> To undersand TIME COMPLEXITY of an ALGORITHM
(n) are the number of elements in the ARRAY, if (n) increases, the time increases to execute  

    1. O(1) : Constant Time  ---> used in "READ" opeartions
    2. O(Log n) : Constant Time ---> log 8 = 3, log 16 = 4, that means as (n) increases, the time increases by one step, example: "BINARY SEARCH"
    
    3. O(n) : Linear Time ---> it is "Linear SEARCH"
    4. O(n log n) : Linearithmic time --->
    5. O(n^2) : Quadratic Time --->
    6. O(2^n) : exponential Time --->
    7. O(n!) : Factorial Time --->

SORTING

Types of Sorting :

            1. Bubble Sorting -->
                "Not Efficient, but easy to understand
                Step 1 : take an element in the array,
                consider it as bubble and shift it to the end"

                Step 2: Task is "ASCENDING SORTING" --> compare two values at a time.
                "Sort & SWAP"

                Step 3: Say the pointer at 2 values @ index 0 and 1, compare the two values (if first value is greater than 2nd value --> SWAP, else don't)

                Step 4: now, shift the pointer at 2 values @ index 1 and 2, compare the two values (if the value at index 1 is > than value at index 2 --> SWAP, else don't)

                Step 5: Repeat the steps till the pointer shifts to last values @ index n-1 and n, if the value at n-1 > n, the --> SWAP, else don't)

                -------This is the 1st iteration--------
                -------repeat it in 2nd Iteration-------
                -------repeat it in 3rd Iteration-------
                ----Till the whole array is sorted------

            "The time Complexity of Bubble sort is 
            O(n^2), because we use two loops, one for iteraton and the inner loop is for comparing and swapping the values"




            2. Selection Sorting -->
            3. Insertion Sorting -->
            4. Merge Sorting -->
            5. Quick Sorting -->
            6. Counting Sorting -->
            7. Radix Sorting -->
            8. Heap Sorting -->
            9. Bucket Sorting -->
